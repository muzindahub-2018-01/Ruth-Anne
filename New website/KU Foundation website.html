			<p class="obama">"No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens. There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish." -<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/07/30/remarks-first-lady-summit-mandela-washington-fellowship-young-african-le" target="_blank">Michelle Obama</a></p>	

			<p class="winfrey"> "Every time you state what you want or believe, you're the first to hear it. It's a message to both you and others about what you think is possible. Don't put a ceiling on yourself. "Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness." -<a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/33474.html" target="_blank">Oprah Winfrey</a></p>

			<p class="maya">Because i'm woman phenomenally. Phenomenal woman, that's me! <br> Each time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it possibly, without claiming it, she stands up for all women!" -<a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48985/phenomenal-woman" target="_blank">Maya Angelou</a></p>

			<p class="nelson">To deny people their human right is to challenge their very humanity. Our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual." -<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/05/world/iyw-mandela-charitable-legacy/index.html" target="_blank">Nelson Mandela</a></p>

			<p class="adichie">“Some people ask: “Why the word feminist? Why not just say you are a believer in human rights, or something like that?” Because that would be dishonest. Feminism is, of course, part of human rights in general—but to choose to use the vague expression human rights is to deny the specific and particular problem of gender. It would be a way of pretending that it was not women who have, for centuries, been excluded. It would be a way of denying that the problem of gender targets women.” -<a href="http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/genwom/adichie.html" target="_blank">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a></p>
